        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p> <em> Born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany in 1879, Albert Einstein had a passion for inquiry that eventually led him
          to develop
          the special and general theories of relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his
          explanation of the
          photoelectric effect and immigrated to the U.S. in the following decade after being targeted by the Nazis.
          Einstein is
          generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century, with his work also having a major
          impact on the
          development of atomic energy. With a focus on unified field theory during his later years, Einstein died on
          April 18,
          1955, in Princeton, New Jersey.

          <li><strong>1884</strong>  <br>
            Receives his first compass around this time, inspiring a lifelong quest to investigate mysteries of the

          </li>
          <li><strong>1889</strong>  <br>
            Settles into a program of self-education at age 10 and begins reading as much about science as he can. <br> <br>
          </li>
          <li><strong>1894</strong>  <br>
            Stays on in Munich to finish the school year after his parents move to Pavia, Italy. Lasts only one term on
            his own and

          </li>
          <li><strong>1895</strong>  <br>
            Attempts to skip high school by taking an entrance exam to the Swiss Polytechnic, a top technical
            university, but fails
            the arts portion. His family sends him to the Swiss town of Aarau to finish high school. <br> <br>
          </li>
